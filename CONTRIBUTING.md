#### 1. Fork the Repository

First, fork the `PDF-Assistant-Chatbot` (or the current correct repository name, e.g., `Chatbot_Pinecone_flask_backend` if it hasn't been renamed yet) repository to your GitHub account.

#### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Chatbot_Pinecone_flask_backend.git
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME and ensure Chatbot_Pinecone_flask_backend is the correct repo name
cd Chatbot_Pinecone_flask_backend
# Or the actual directory name created by the clone
```

#### 3. Set Up Your Environment

*   **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
*   **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt # For linters, testing tools
    ```

#### 4. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name  # For new features
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description   # For bug fixes
```

#### 5. Make Your Changes

*   Write clean, readable, and well-commented code.
*   Follow the existing code style and conventions.
*   Ensure your changes are focused on the specific feature or bug.

#### 6. Run Linters and Formatters

Before committing, ensure your code adheres to the project's linting and formatting standards:
```bash
make lint
make format  # To automatically format
```
This typically involves running tools like Flake8, Black, and isort.

#### 7. Run Tests

Ensure all existing tests pass and, if you're adding a feature or fixing a bug, add new tests to cover your changes:
```bash
make test
# or
pytest
```

#### 8. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages.

git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement X feature"
# or

# (Consider using Conventional Commits style if adopted by the project)
```

#### 9. Push to Your Fork

Push your changes to your forked repository:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### 10. Open a Pull Request (PR)

*   Go to the original repository on GitHub.
*   You should see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your recently pushed branch.
*   Use the Pull Request template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) if available.
*   Clearly describe the changes you've made, why they were made, and link any relevant issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
*   Ensure your PR is made against the `main` or `dev` branch of the upstream repository, as appropriate.

## Code Style and Conventions

*   Follow [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
*   Use type hinting where appropriate.
